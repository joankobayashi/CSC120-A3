Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    Daniela Ramos
    Elise Farstad (They both really helped me understand the concept of for loops and how to make arrays where I store the changed words.)
    Ngoc Dang

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    <TA> Tuesday night 7-9:30

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    Very confusing and too precise because I have only used python. 
    I didn't get the idea of object oriented programming well. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    Similarities: You have to plan the whole process (the bones) first. You have to be patient and trust the process. 

    Differences: For java, you need to also think of the type of the object beforehand and the debugging process is more straightforward than python. But the codes do get longer so it is hard to process its purpose quickly, unlike python. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I tried out little by little and printed out the names to make sure it was working and that helped a lot with finding out where the problem was. Assuming a use of a function name (from its similar use in python) without checking it made it difficult to debug later when it had little exceptions to its use. Definitely getting used to the practice set was helpful. And also TA hours (when the TAs are familiar with java.)
